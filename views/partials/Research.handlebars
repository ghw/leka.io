     <div id="research3"><h5>Our main goal is to demonstrate by proofs that robotic is an effective tool to reduce anxiety and enhance autism therapies. We want to provide a robotic toy that behind its fun and playing proprieties include functionnalities proven to be helpful for those in the autism spectrum. You can learn more about evidence-based practices guidelines on the website of the [National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorder](http://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/evidence-based-practices).</h5></div>
      <div id="research4"><h3>First tests with 70 children showed they are : More interested in the robot than with classic toys, Motivated to play all along the 15 minutes session, Communicative & joyful when playing with the robot.</h3></div>
